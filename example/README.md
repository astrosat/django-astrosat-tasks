This is just a little test project that uses django-astrosat-users.
Obviously, it also requires django-astrosat-core.

It is there to

1. develop code & test out ideas
2. build migrations
3. run tests

Note that unlike other astrosat reusable apps,
it runs inside Docker in order to setup a task broker.
